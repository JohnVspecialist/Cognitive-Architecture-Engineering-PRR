# Cognitive Architecture Engineering + Polyrhythmic Reasoning (PRR)

This repository unifies **Cognitive Architecture Engineering (CAE)** with **Polyrhythmic Reasoning (PRR)**.

- **CAE** provides the shell: invariants, observability, boundaries, safety, and accountability.
- **PRR** provides the core: multi-threaded reasoning loops in polyrhythmic cadence (4/4 vs 5/4).

## Features
- Deterministic invariants over probabilistic reasoning.
- Production-focused observability hooks.
- Extensible reasoning loops embedded in architectural guarantees.

## Usage
```bash
python examples/demo_unified.py

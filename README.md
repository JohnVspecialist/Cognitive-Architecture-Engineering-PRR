This repository unifies **Cognitive Architecture Engineering (CAE)** with **Polyrhythmic Reasoning (PRR)**.  

- **CAE** provides the shell: invariants, observability, boundaries, safety, and accountability.  
- **PRR** provides the core: multi-threaded reasoning loops in polyrhythmic cadence (4/4 vs 5/4).  

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Deterministic invariants over probabilistic reasoning.  
- Production-focused observability hooks.  
- Extensible reasoning loops embedded in architectural guarantees.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JohnVspecialist/Cognitive-Architecture-Engineering-PRR.git
cd Cognitive-Architecture-Engineering-PRR
